PHP Exception Handling:
Exceptions are used to change the normal flow of a script if a specified error occurs

What is an Exception:
With PHP 5 came a new object oriented way of dealing with errors.
Exception handling is used to change the normal flow of the code execution if a specified error (exceptional) condition occurs. This condition is called an exception.

This is what normally happens when an exception is triggered:
 The current code state is saved
 The code execution will switch to a predefined (custom) exception handler function
 Depending on the situation, the handler may then resume the execution from the saved code state,
terminate the script execution or continue the script from a different location in the code

We will show different error handling methods:
 Basic use of Exceptions
 Creating a custom exception handler
 Multiple exceptions
 Re-throwing an exception
 Setting a top level exception handler
Note: Exceptions should only be used with error conditions, and should not be used to jump to another place in the code at a specified point.
