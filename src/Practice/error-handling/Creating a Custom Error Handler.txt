Creating a Custom Error Handler:
Creating a custom error handler is quite simple. We simply create a special function that can be called when an error occurs in PHP.

This function must be able to handle a minimum of two parameters (error level and error message) but can accept up to five parameters (optionally: file, line-number, and the error context):

Syntax:
error_function(error_level,error_message, error_file,error_line,error_context)
Parameter                   Description
error_level                 Required. Specifies the error report level for the user-defined error. Must be a value number. See table below for possible error report levels
error_message               Required. Specifies the error message for the user-defined error
error_file                  Optional. Specifies the filename in which the error occurred
error_line                  Optional. Specifies the line number in which the error occurred
error_context               Optional. Specifies an array containing every variable, and their values, in use when the error occurred

Error Report levels:
These error report levels are the different types of error the user-defined error handler can be used for:
Value   Constant            Description
2       E_WARNING           Non-fatal run-time errors. Execution of the script is not halted
8       E_NOTICE            Run-time notices. The script found something that might be an error, but could also happen when running a script normally
256     E_USER_ERROR        Fatal user-generated error. This is like an E_ERROR set by the programmer using the PHP function trigger_error()
512     E_USER_WARNING      Non-fatal user-generated warning. This is like an E_WARNING set by the programmer using the PHP function trigger_error()
1024    E_USER_NOTICE       User-generated notice. This is like an E_NOTICE set by the programmer using the PHP function trigger_error()
4096    E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR Catchable fatal error. This is like an E_ERROR but can be caught by a user defined handle (see also set_error_handler())
8191    E_ALL               All errors and warnings, except level E_STRICT (E_STRICT will be part of E_ALL as of PHP 6.0)
