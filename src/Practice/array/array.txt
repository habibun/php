PHP Arrays:

An array can store one or more values in a single variable name.
What is an array?
When working with PHP, sooner or later, you might want to create many similar variables.
Instead of having many similar variables, you can store the data as elements in an array.
Each element in the array has its own ID so that it can be easily accessed.


an array is a data structure that stores one or more values in a single values.

in php there are three kinds of array:
1.Numeric array()
2.Associative array()
3.Multidimensional array()


*in array array key or position key is called offset in programming language.

in below this is example that change offset's element's value
<?php
$MyArray = array(11,12,13,14,15);
for($i=0;$i<5;$i++)
    $MyArray[$i] = $MyArray[$i]*$MyArray[$i];
print_r($MyArray);
?>

*in php if a array's offset is numeric it is called indexed array.
*if a array's offset is string it is called associative array.


important:

*in array while,do while,for loop are not use in array.
only foreach loop is use in array.

<?php
$name=array(0=>"jony",1=>"rony",2=>"sumon");//this array jony rony and sumon is called element
print_r($name);
?>
