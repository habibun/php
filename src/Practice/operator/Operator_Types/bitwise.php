$a & $b             And                         Bits that are set in both $a and $b are set.
$a | $b             Or (inclusive or)           Bits that are set in either $a or $b are set.
$a ^ $b             Xor (exclusive or)          Bits that are set in $a or $b but no both are set.
~ $a                Not                         Bits that are set in $a are not set, and vice vice versa.
$a << $b            Shift left                  Shift the bits of $a $b steps to the left(each step means "multiply by two").
$a >> $b            Shift right                 Shift the bits of $a $b steps to the right(each step means "divide by two").
