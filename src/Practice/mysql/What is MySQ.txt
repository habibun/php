What is MySQL?
MySQL is a database. A database defines a structure for storing information.

In a database, there are tables. Just like HTML tables, database tables contain rows, columns, and cells.

Databases are useful when storing information categorically.
A company may have a database with the following tables:
"Employees", "Products", "Customers" and "Orders".
