A function is a block of code that can be executed whenever we need it.
Creating PHP functions:
 All functions start with the word "function()"
 Name the function - It should be possible to understand what the function does by its name.
The name can start with a letter or underscore (not a number)
 Add a "{"  - The function code starts after the opening curly brace
 Insert the function code
 Add a "}"  - The function is finished by a closing curly brace


PHP Functions - Adding parameters:

Our first function (writeMyName()) is a very simple function. It only writes a static string.
To add more functionality to a function, we can add parameters. A parameter is just like a variable.
You may have noticed the parentheses after the function name, like: writeMyName(). The parameters are specified inside the parentheses.
