What is a PHP Filter?
A PHP filter is used to validate and filter data coming from insecure sources.
To test, validate and filter user input or custom data is an important part of any web application.
The PHP filter extension is designed to make data filtering easier and quicker.

Why use a Filter?
Almost all web applications depend on external input. Usually this comes from a user or another application (like a web service). By using filters you can be sure your application gets the correct input type.
You should always filter all external data!
Input filtering is one of the most important application security issues.

What is external data?
 Input data from a form
 Cookies
 Web services data
 Server variables
 Database query results

There are two kinds of filters:
Validating filters:
 Are used to validate user input
 Strict format rules (like URL or E-Mail validating)
 Returns the expected type on success or FALSE on failure

Sanitizing filters:
 Are used to allow or disallow specified characters in a string
 No data format rules
