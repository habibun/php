PHP $_POST:
The $_POST variable is used to collect values from a form with method="post".

The $_POST Variable:
The $_POST variable is an array of variable names and values sent by the HTTP POST method.
The $_POST variable is used to collect values from a form with method="post". Information sent from a form with the POST method is invisible to others and has no limits on the amount of information to send.

Example:
 <form action="welcome.php" method="post">
 Enter your name: <input type="text" name="name" />
 Enter your age: <input type="text" name="age" />
 <input type="submit" />
 </form>

When the user clicks the "Submit" button, the URL will not contain any form data, and will look something like this:
http://www.w3schools.com/welcome.php

The "welcome.php" file can now use the $_POST variable to catch the form data (notice that the names of the form fields will automatically be the ID keys in the $_POST array):
Welcome <?php echo $_POST["name"]; ?>.<br />
You are <?php echo $_POST["age"]; ?> years old!

Why use $_POST?:
 Variables sent with HTTP POST are not shown in the URL   Variables have no length limit
However, because the variables are not displayed in the URL, it is not possible to bookmark the page.
