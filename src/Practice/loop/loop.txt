PHP Looping
Looping statements in PHP are used to execute the same block of code a specified number of times.

Looping
Very often when you write code, you want the same block of code to run a number of times. You can use looping statements in your code to perform this.


In PHP we have the following looping statements:
 while - loops through a block of code if and as long as a specified condition is true
 do...while - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as a special condition is true
 for - loops through a block of code a specified number of times
 foreach - loops through a block of code for each element in an array
