# keep it simple, stupid (KISS)
KISS, an acronym for keep it simple, stupid, is a design principle noted by the U.S. Navy in 1960.
The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; 
therefore, simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.
