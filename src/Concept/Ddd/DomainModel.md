A domain model is a conceptual representation of the major items that must be understood to build a system the customer wants. You can think of it as the foundational design of a system, but one that both stakeholders and developers can understand.

There are many ways to capture a domain model. This can be in the form of bullet points on wiki pages, or something much more formal. One of the most common ways is to use diagrams.

>Basically, it's the "model" of the objects required for your business purposes.
Say you were making a sales tracking website - you'd potentially have classes such as Customer, Vendor, Transaction, etc. That entire set of classes, as well as the relationships between them, would consititute your Domain Model.
