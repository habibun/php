Entity and value objects are divided into aggregation and define the boundary around the aggregation.
Select an entity as the root of each aggregation and allow only external objects to hold references to the aggregation root.
Define the attributes and invariants of the aggregation as a whole and assign responsibility for their execution to the aggregation root or the specified framework mechanism.
