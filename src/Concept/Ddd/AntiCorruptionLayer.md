Relationships between bounded contexts pose the problem of how the development of one context influences the other over time. The safest way of dealing with related contexts is by creating an anticorruption layer (ACL).

Itâ€™s the safest way because all the changes required to keep the contexts in sync when one undergoes changes are isolated in the anticorruption layer, as shown in Figure 5-6.

FIGURE 5-6
FIGURE 5-6 The anticorruption layer is an interfacing layer that separates two connected contexts.

The interface that the ACL exposes to the downstream context (the club site in this case) is an invariant. The ACL, in fact, absorbs the changes in the upstream context (Weather Forecasts service in this case) and does any conversion work that might be required. Updating the ACL when the upstream context changes usually requires less work and is less obtrusive than updating the club-site context.

The ACL is particularly welcome when one of the bounded contexts encapsulates a chunk of legacy code or just an external service that none of the teams building the system has control over.
